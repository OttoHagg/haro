Haro SWT
========

Hello,

Haro is a library of custom SWT components and widgets I've built over the years. I should have done this a long time ago, frankly, but...

## What's in Haro?

As time permits I'll package my other odds-n-ends into the haro library but, for now, there's:

* [FileExplorer](https://github.com/OttoHagg/haro/wiki/FileExplorer), a component that makes adding a file explorer to your application trivial.
* [Waveform](https://github.com/OttoHagg/haro/wiki/Waveform), a widget for displaying the waveform of an audio file.

## Building

### Requirements

* [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
* [SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/)

### Steps

* Clone or "Download ZIP"
* Run build.xml
* Grab the jar from build/lib and add it to your project

## Documentation

What's that? See src/test/java for snippets.
